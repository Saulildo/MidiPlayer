# MidiPlayer
Original by [0866's MidiPlayer](https://github.com/richie0866/MidiPlayer), a virtual piano MIDI file autoplayer for Roblox.
Forked from [zoeyluau](https://github.com/zoeyluau/MidiPlayer).
Run
```loadstring(game:HttpGetAsync('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoeyluau/MidiPlayer/refs/heads/main/src/init.lua'))()``` and go to your executor's workspace path and there should be a new folder named midi created. Place your downloaded MIDI files and instantly use them.

This script, in reality, only replaces all the require methods in all of the scripts with loadstring, which could slow down execution time.
